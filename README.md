# webcasting-integration

The Kaltura Webcasting suite provides a set of tools to broadcast live events on the web, including interactive video and slides-sync, in-stream audience polls, moderated Q&A chat and live announcements. [Kaltura Webcasting]((https://webcasting.kaltura.com/)) currently supports the following live source ingest protocols: RTMP, RTSP, SIP or WebRTC. 

The Kaltura suite of Webcasting tools can be integrated as a native component of any web application, and enhance your applications with video live-streaming and webcasting capabilities.  
This guide will walk you through the steps needed to set up the Webcast Launcher and embed the Kaltura livestream video player in your webpage. 

## Before You Begin 

To get started, you'll need a Kaltura account, which you can sign up for [here](https://vpaas.kaltura.com/reg/index.php). You'll also need the webcasting module enabled on your account. Speak to your account manager or email us at vpaas@kaltura.com to get your account configured. 

For a better understanding of this integration, check out the [Python sample app](https://github.com/kaltura-vpaas/webcasting-app-python) that demonstrates everything explained in this guide. 

## Creating a LiveStream Object 

At the basis of a Kaltura Webcast is a Live Stream (non-interactive live broadcast). To create a webcast stream you'll first need to create a [LiveStream](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/General_Objects/Objects/KalturaLiveStreamEntry) object, which we'll do using the [liveStream.add](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/liveStream/action/add) action. Then we'll add some configurations in order to turn this live stream into an interactive webcast. 

We'll be creating an object with **`sourceType`** of `LIVE_STREAM [32]` with the parameters described here: 

### Live Stream Parameters 

| Parameter  | Type  | Value  | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| name  | string  | name of livestream | name of livestream |
| description  | string  | description of livestream | description of livestream |
| mediaType  | enum  | KalturaMediaType.LIVE_STREAM_FLASH | indicates RTMP, RTSP, SIP or WebRTC source encoder |
| dvrStatus  | enum  | KalturaDVRStatus.ENABLED | enable or disable DVR |
| dvrWindow  | int  | 60 | length of the DVR in minutes (max 1440) |
| recordStatus  | enum  | KalturaRecordStatus.APPENDED | individual recording per event / append all events to one recording / disable recording |
| adminTags  | enum  | "vpaas-webcast" | required for analytics to track source |
| pushPublishEnabled  | enum  | KalturaLivePublishStatus.DISABLED | should only be enabled if multicasting is set up |
| explicitLive  | enum  | KalturaNullableBoolean.TRUE_VALUE | determines whether admins can preview the stream before going live* |
| conversionProfileId  | int  | ID of desired conversion profile | cloud transcoding vs passthrough* |


> * **explicitLive** : If set to true, only a KS with the `restrictexplicitliveview` privilege will be allowed to watch the stream before it is live (determined by the `isLive` flag). If set to false, the preview will not be available to any viewers, and `isLive` will be set automatically when the broadcast begins.   
> * **conversionProfileId**: Use [`conversionProfile.list`](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/conversionProfile/action/list) with filter of `typeEqual = KalturaConversionProfileType.LIVE_STREAM[2]` to find the profile IDs for cloud transcoding or passthrough


### RecordingOptions 

We'll also add a RecordingOptions object with these parameters: 

| Parameter  | Type  | Value  | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| shouldCopyEntitlement  | enum  | KalturaNullableBoolean.TRUE_VALUE | copy user entitlement settings from Live entry to Recorded VOD entry |
| shouldMakeHidden  | enum  | KalturaNullableBoolean.TRUE_VALUE | hide the VOD entry in KMC, to only be accessible via the Live entry |
| shouldAutoArchive  | enum  | KalturaNullableBoolean.TRUE_VALUE | automatically archives the recording, in order  to separate it from other live instances |

Finally, the API call takes the webcastEntry we just created, and the **`sourceType`** of `LIVE_STREAM [32]`, resulting in something that looks like this: 

### Creating a Live Stream - Python Code Example

```python
live_stream_entry = KalturaLiveStreamEntry()
live_stream_entry.name = "Webcast Tutorial"
live_stream_entry.description = "This is a test webcast"
live_stream_entry.mediaType = KalturaMediaType.LIVE_STREAM_FLASH
live_stream_entry.dvrStatus = KalturaDVRStatus.ENABLED
live_stream_entry.dvrWindow = 60
live_stream_entry.sourceType = KalturaSourceType.LIVE_STREAM
live_stream_entry.adminTags = "vpaas-webcast"
live_stream_entry.pushPublishEnabled = KalturaLivePublishStatus.DISABLED

live_stream_entry.explicitLive = KalturaNullableBoolean.TRUE_VALUE
live_stream_entry.recordStatus = KalturaRecordStatus.PER_SESSION
live_stream_entry.conversionProfileId = 0000000 

live_stream_entry.recordingOptions = KalturaLiveEntryRecordingOptions()
live_stream_entry.recordingOptions.shouldCopyEntitlement = KalturaNullableBoolean.TRUE_VALUE
live_stream_entry.recordingOptions.shouldMakeHidden = KalturaNullableBoolean.TRUE_VALUE
live_stream_entry.recordingOptions.shouldAutoArchive = KalturaNullableBoolean.TRUE_VALUE

source_type = KalturaSourceType.LIVE_STREAM

result = client.liveStream.add(live_stream_entry, source_type)

```

### Result 

The result of the above code sample is a KalturaLiveStreamEntry object that will look like this (abbreviated for brevity):

```json
{
  "primaryBroadcastingUrl": "rtmp://1_yo43efjn.p.kpublish.kaltura.com:1935/kLive?t=6c1ac379",
  "secondaryBroadcastingUrl": "rtmp://1_yo43efjn.b.kpublish.kaltura.com:1935/kLive?t=6c1ac379",

  "primaryRtspBroadcastingUrl": "rtsp://1_yo43efjn.p.s.kpublish.kaltura.com:554/kLive/1_yo43efjn_%i?t=6c1ac379",
  "secondaryRtspBroadcastingUrl": "rtsp://1_yo43efjn.b.s.kpublish.kaltura.com:554/kLive/1_yo43efjn_%i?t=6c1ac379",
  "streamName": "1_yo43efjn_%i",

  },
  "liveStatus": 0,
  "segmentDuration": 6000,
  "explicitLive": true,

  "conversionProfileId": 5195112,
  "...": "...",
  "...": "...",
  "...": "...",
  "objectType": "KalturaLiveStreamEntry"
}
```

## Metadata 

When the webcasting module is enabled on your account, two metadata profiles get created automatically. These are templates for schemas that contain information about the stream and the presenter. Once the schemas are populated, these profiles are updated on the liveStream entry that we just created. This data is needed by the webcast studio app in order to connect to the platform and display the event information. This metadata is also used by applications such as Kaltura MediaSpace to present scheduling information.

### Retrieving Metadata Profiles 

The auto-generated profiles are created with the names `KMS_KWEBCAST2` and `KMS_EVENTS3`. In order to use these profiles, you'll need the specific instances found in your account, so we'll use the [metadataProfile.list](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/metadataProfile/action/list) API to filter on the **systemName** and get the respective profile IDs. 

```python
filter = KalturaMetadataProfileFilter()
filter.systemNameEqual = "KMS_KWEBCAST2"
pager = KalturaFilterPager()

result = client.metadata.metadataProfile.list(filter, pager)
```

> [Learn about Kaltura Custom Metadata](https://knowledge.kaltura.com/help/custom-data).

You'll get a metadata profile that contains an XSD object, or [XML schema](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp), which defines the XML we'll want to create for the webcast. You'll want to use tools in the language of your choice to create an XML object from the schema and add the relevant values. For the purpose of this guide, however, we'll work with the XML directly, to give you a better understanding of what it looks like.  

#### KMS_KWEBCAST2

The XML defined by the KMS_KWEBCAST2 schema contains the following fields:

* `SlidesDocEntryId`: Representing Entry ID of the presentation slides entry (read more about [documents](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/service/documents))
* `IsKwebcastEntry` - Boolean (0/1) indicates whether this is a live stream entry of type Interactive Webcast
* `IsSelfServe` - Boolean (0/1) indicates whether WebRTC-based self-broadcast should be enabled inside the Webcasting Studio Application (if set to false, the webcasting app will enable the use of an external encoder).

#### KMS_KWEBCAST2 XML Example:   

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<metadata>
   <SlidesDocEntryId>1_78bsdfg8</SlidesDocEntryId>
  <IsKwebcastEntry>1</IsKwebcastEntry>
  <IsSelfServe>1</IsSelfServe>
</metadata>
```

The custom metadata is then updated using [`metadata.add`](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/metadata/action/add):

```python
metadata_profile_id = "<metadata profile ID retrieved above>"
object_type = KalturaMetadataObjectType.ENTRY
object_id = "<ID of livestream entry>"
xml_data = "<XML string>"

client.metadata.metadata.add(metadata_profile_id, object_type, object_id, xml_data)
```

That will return an object with a `metadataRecordId`, which you can use at any point for an update using [`metadata.update`](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/metadata/action/update): 

```python
saved_metadata = client.metadata.metadata.update(metadata_record_id, xml_data)
```

#### KMS_EVENTS3

Similarly, you'll need the ID of the metadata profile, which we'll retrieve using its name in the [metadataProfile.list](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/metadataProfile/action/list) API:

```python
filter = KalturaMetadataProfileFilter()
filter.systemNameEqual = "KMS_EVENTS3"
pager = KalturaFilterPager()

result = client.metadata.metadataProfile.list(filter, pager)
```

This XML contains event information, such as the start and end times (in unix timestamps), the time zone, and information about the speaker - name, title, bio, etc. 

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<metadata>
  <StartTime>1589137200</StartTime>
  <EndTime>1589137440</EndTime>
  <Timezone>Asia/Jerusalem</Timezone>
  <Presenter>
    <PresenterId>8723792</PresenterId>
    <PresenterName>John Doe</PresenterName>
    <PresenterTitle>CEO and Chairman</PresenterTitle>
    <PresenterBio>Awesome biography here</PresenterBio>
    <PresenterLink>https://www.linkedin.com/in/john.doe</PresenterLink>
    <PresenterImage>https://speakerheadshot.com/image.png</PresenterImage>
  </Presenter>
</metadata>
```

Like the first schema, the XML is populated with the relevant values and added to the liveStream entry with the [`metadata.add`](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/metadata/action/add) API as seen above. 


## The Webcasting Studio App 

### Creating Download Links 

The admins, or person presenting, will need to download and use the Kaltura Webcasting Desktop Application. To add download links to your webpage for the Kaltura Webcasting Studio, we'll make a call to the [systemUIConf.listTemplates](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/uiConf/action/listTemplates) API to list instances of Webcasting UI Configs and grab the first one. 
Then we'll parse it to find the recommended versions for OSX and Windows. 

```python 
filter = KalturaUiConfFilter()
filter.objTypeEqual = KalturaUiConfObjType.WEBCASTING
pager = KalturaFilterPager()

result = client.uiConf.listTemplates(filter, pager)
first = result.objects[0]
config = json.loads(first.config)

mac_download_url = config['osx']['recommendedVersionUrl']
win_download_url = config['windows']['recommendedVersionUrl']
```

These URLS can be embedded to the page to automatically download the recommended version of the app. 

### Application Launch 

To launch the application, you'll need the attached [KAppLauncher script](https://github.com/kaltura-vpaas/webcasting-integration/blob/master/KAppLauncher.js), which requires the following params: 

#### Launch Params 

* **KS**: the Kaltura Session authentication string that should be used (see below)
* **ks_expiry:** the time that the KS will expire in format `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+00:00`
* **MediaEntryId:** entry ID of the livestream
* **checkForUpdates:** whether the application should check for update (default: true)
* **uiConfId:** The uiConfId that holds data for webcasting application version, and where it needs an update. Differs for mac and windows 
* **serverAddress:** API server address (ie https://www.kaltura.com) 
* **eventsMetadataProfileId:(optional)**  ID of the metadata profile that contains presenter information
* **kwebcastMetadataProfileId:(optional)**  ID of the metadata profile that contains webcasting information
* **appName (optional):** name of the application shown on splash screen (default: "Kaltura Webcast Studio")
* **logoUrl (optional):** URL for company logo to be shown on top left of application (160 x 80 or similar ratio)
* **fromDate (optional):** start time of the event (for the progress bar in the top right) in format `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+00:00`
* **toDate (optional):** anticipated end time of the event (for the progress bar in the top right), in format `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+00:00`
* **userId:** username that current user is associated with
* **QnAEnabled:** whether `Q&A` module is enabled (default: true)
* **pollsEnabled:** whether `Polls` module is enabled (default: true)
* **userRole:** refers to KMS roles. Should be set to `adminRole`
* **presentationConversionProfileId:** conversion profile ID used for converting presentations (see below)
* **referer:[optional]**  URL of the referring site or domain name
* **verifySSL:** if set to false, the application can get to https sites with unverified certificates. Used mainly for development (default: true)
* **selfServeEnabled:** whether the self-serve module is enabled (default: false)
* **participantsPanel:** whether to display the participants panel (default: true)
* **appHostUrl:** base-URL of the webpage hosting the site. Used to open links to external entry data
* **myHostingAppName:** simple alpha-numeric string that represents the hosting application's name


#### Creating a Kaltura Session for a Studio Launch 

You'll create a type USER session using the [`session.start`](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/session/action/start) API, with privileges to the given entry and role of WEBCAST_PRODUCER_DEVICE_ROLE. 

Partner ID and Admin Secret can be found in your KMC [Integration Settings](https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/settings/integrationSettings). 

Assuming a livestreamEntry ID of `1_yo43efjn`, Kaltura Session creation would look something like this:

```python
secret = "xxxxx"
user_id = "user-email-address"
k_type = KalturaSessionType.USER
partner_id = 1234567
expiry = 86400
privileges = "setrole:WEBCAST_PRODUCER_DEVICE_ROLE,sview:*,list:1_yo43efjn,download:1_yo43efjn"

result = client.session.start(secret, user_id, k_type, partner_id, expiry, privileges)
```
The above KS would give this user producer access to the entry within the Webcasting Studio. 

#### Player UiConf 

Most likely you were given the correct UiConf when Webcasting was enabled on your account, but if you're not sure which it is, you can use the [uiConf.list](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/uiConf/action/list) API to find it. 
Just filter on `filter.nameLike = "MediaSpace Webcast Player"` and grab that ID. 

#### Presentation Conversion Profile ID

This is needed in the case that a presenter chooses to upload a presentation. *It will not work if you don't have a conversion profile ID.* 
You can find it with the [conversionProfile.list](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/conversionProfile/action/list) API, by grabbing the first item in the results. 


```python
filter = KalturaConversionProfileFilter()
pager = KalturaFilterPager()

result = client.conversionProfile.list(filter, pager)

first = result.objects[0]
conversion_profile_id = first.id
```

### Launching the Webcasting Studio App 

So now that you've got all your parameters, you can add a link on your webpage that will instantly open the Webcasting Studio (see instructions for download links below). 

You'll first need to load the script to the application [launcher](https://github.com/kaltura-vpaas/webcasting-integration/blob/master/KAppLauncher.js) in the header of your HTML:

```html
<head>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="KAppLauncher.js"></script>
</head>
```

Create the button: 

```html 
<body>
  <button id="launchProducerApp">Launch Kaltura Webcast App</button>
</body>
```

Depending on your application, you can either create the params dictionary for the launcher object with javascript code, or pass it from the backend of your application, which is how it's done in the [python sample](https://github.com/kaltura-vpaas/webcasting-app-python). 

We'll show it here in javascript. The params object is created using the data we've collected above, and then the click of the `launchProducerApp` button will create a new Launcher object and start the application with all of the parameters. 

```javascript 
document.getElementById("launchProducerApp").onclick = launchKalturaWebcast;

function launchKalturaWebcast() {
    const kapp = new KAppLauncher();

    const params = {
        'ks' => <KALTURA SESSION>,
        'ks_expiry' => <EXPIRY DATE 'Y-m-d\TH:i:sP'>,
        'MediaEntryId' => <LIVESTEAM ENTRY>,
        'serverAddress' => <SERVICE URL>,
        'eventsMetadataProfileId' => <KMS_EVENTS3 ID>,
        'kwebcastMetadataProfileId' => <KMS_KWEBCAST2 ID>,
        'appName' => <APP NAME>,
        'logoUrl' => <URL OF COMPANY LOGO>,
        'fromDate' => <START TIME 'Y-m-d\TH:i:sP'>,
        'toDate' => <END TIME 'Y-m-d\TH:i:sP'>,
        'userId' => <USER ID>,
        'QnAEnabled' => <TRUE / FALSE>,
        'pollsEnabled' => <TRUE / FALSE>,
        'userRole' => "adminRole", 
        'presentationConversionProfileId' => <CONVERSION PROFILE ID>,
        'referer' => <REFERRING SITE>,
        'debuggingMode' => false, 
        'verifySSL' => true,
        'selfServeEnabled' => <TRUE / FALSE>,
        'appHostUrl' => <APP HOST URL>,
        'instanceProfile' => <HOSTING APP NAME>
        };
    
    kapp.startApp(params, function(isSupported, failReason) {
        if (!isSupported && failReason !== 'browserNotAware') {
            alert(res + " " + reason);
        } 
    }, 3000, true);
}
```

## Viewing the Livestream

When the broadcast is live, there's a delay of about thirty seconds before it is available to the viewer. During this time, the preview is available to a user with a Kaltura Session that contains "explictivlive" in the privilege string (for moderators who are involved in testing)

Do determine whether an entry is live, you can call the [isLive](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/liveStream/action/isLive) with the entry ID. 
The Kaltura Player does this automatically for live entries, but we'll want to determine whether to play the live entry, or whether to replace it with the recorded entry if the Live Event is already complete. 

```python
is_live = client.liveStream.isLive(entry_id, KalturaPlaybackProtocol.AUTO)
if (is_live == False):
    if ((livestream.redirectEntryId) and livestream.redirectEntryId != ''):
        entry_id = livestream.redirectEntryId
    elif ((livestream.recordedEntryId) and livestream.recordedEntryId != ''):
        entry_id = livestream.recordedEntryId
```

For the case of `PER_SESSION` recording, a new recording is created for every session, which means that the `recordedEntryId` field on the livestream Entry will be reset immediately to make room for a new recordedEntry. We find the entry by using [`baseEntry.list`](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/baseEntry/action/list) with the **rootEntryId** equal to our livestream entry:

```python
    else:
        filter = KalturaBaseEntryFilter()
        filter.rootEntryIdEqual = entry_id
        pager = KalturaFilterPager()

        result = client.baseEntry.list(filter, pager)
        if (result.objects):
            entry_id = result.objects[0].id
```

Now that we have an entry ID for playback, we can create a Kaltura Session for the player embed. 
The most important part of the player KS is the privileges string, comma-separated key-value  string that contains information about the user and the app, to be used for analytics and playback permission. It needs the entry ID, the user ID, and application ID and domain. 
The string looks something like this - using the format tool to concatenate values:

```python
privileges = "sview:{},enableentitlement,appid:{},appdomain:{},sessionkey:{}" \
  .format(entry_id, entry_id, config.app_id, config.app_domain, user_id)
```
With that privilege string, we create a USER Kaltura Session using the [`session.start`](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/session/action/start) API as seen above.

> Now that we have a Kaltura Session, we can embed the player in an HTML page. We recommend using the v7 player, which is built for speed and performance. However, the functionality for powerpoint slides in the livestream is not yet supported in player v7, so if this is something that is required in your webcasting flow, see Player V2 embed below. 

### Player Embed V7 

You can create a new player in the [Studio](https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/studio/v3) and grab its ID, which is referred to as the UI Conf ID. You'll need to edit it using the [uiconf.update](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/uiConf/action/update) API by passing the ID of the player and the confvars below:

```python
id = "UI CONF ID"
ui_conf = KalturaUiConf()
ui_conf.confVars = "{\"kaltura-ovp-player\":\"0.50.0-vamb.1\", \"playkit-qna\": \"{latest}\", \"playkit-kaltura-live\": \"{latest}\", \"playkit-flash\":\"{latest}\"}"
```

Now in the HTML code, the first thing you'll need is the script that loads the Kaltura Player, which looks like this: 

```javascript
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/{{ partner_id }}/embedPlaykitJs/uiconf_id/{{ uiconf_id }}"></script>
```

The TARGET_ID is the ID of the div that will contain the player:

```html
<div id="kaltura_player"></div>
```

And finally, the player embed script, for which you'll need your Partner ID, the KS we created above, the ID of the viewer, and the ID of the player:

```javascript
    <script>
        var kalturaPlayer = KalturaPlayer.setup({
        targetId: "kaltura_player",
        provider: {
            partnerId: '{{ partner_id }}',
            uiConfId: '{{ uiconf_id }}', 
            ks: '{{ ks }}'
        },
        playback: {
            preload: "auto",
            autoplay: true
        },
        session: {
            userId: '{{ user_id}} '
        }, 
        ui: {
            debug: true
        },
        plugins: {
            "qna": {
                dateFormat: "mmmm do, yyyy",
                expandMode: "OverTheVideo",
                expandOnFirstPlay: true,
                userRole: 'unmoderatedAdminRole' 
                },
            "kaltura-live": {
                checkLiveWithKs: false,
                isLiveInterval: 10
                }
            } 
        });
        kalturaPlayer.loadMedia({entryId: '{{ entry_id }}'});

    </script>
```

You'll see that we've included the plugins for q&a, and for kaltura-live, which enables the polling to the API to check if the entry is already live. 

### Player V2 Embed 

In the HTML code, the first thing you'll need is the script that loads the Kaltura Player, which looks like this: 

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript" src='https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/{PARTNER_ID}/embedPlaykitJs/uiconf_id/{UICONF_ID}?autoembed=true&targetId={TARGET_ID}&entry_id={ENTRY_ID}&config[playback]={"autoplay":true}'></script>
```

The TARGET_ID is the ID of the div that will contain the player:

```html
<div id="kaltura_player"></div>
```

And finally, the player embed script, for which you'll need your Partner ID, the KS we created above, the ID of the viewer, the application name, and the ID of the player:

```javascript
<script>
    kWidget.embed({
        'targetId': 'kaltura_player',
        'wid': '_{{ partner_id }}',
        'uiconf_id': '{{ uiconf_id }}',
        'flashvars':
            {
            'ks': '{{ ks }}',
    'applicationName': '{{ app_name }}',
    'disableAlerts': 'false',
    'externalInterfaceDisabled': 'false',
    'autoPlay': 'true',
            'autoMute': 'false',
            'largePlayBtn.plugin': 'false',
            'expandToggleBtn.plugin':'false',
    'dualScreen': {'plugin': 'true'},
    'chapters': {'plugin': 'true'},
    'sideBarContainer': {'plugin': 'true'},
    'LeadWithHLSOnFlash': 'true',
    'EmbedPlayer.LiveCuepoints': 'true',
    'EmbedPlayer.EnableIpadNativeFullscreen': 'true',
    'qna': {
      'plugin': 'true',
      'moduleWidth': '200',
      'containerPosition': 'right',
      'qnaPollingInterval': '10000',
      'onPage': 'false',
      'userId': '{{ user_id }}',
      'userRole': 'viewerRole',

## Moderator View 

The moderator view is the in-browser interface that allows a moderator to handle Q&A and announcements for the livestream. 
It requires the base URL and a series of query parameters, which include a Kaltura Session of privileges that are similar to the Launcher KS. 

### Base URL 

```
https://www.kaltura.com/apps/webcast/vlatest/index.html?
```

### Parameters 

- **MediaEntryId:** entry ID of the livestream 
- **ks:** Kaltura Session of type USER with privileges described below  
- **ks_expiry:** expiration date of the KS, in format `Y-m-d\TH:i:sP`
- **qnaModeratorMode:** (boolean) whether Q&A is enabled 
- **serverAddress:** service URL 
- **fromDate:** the start date of the livestream, in format `Y-m-d\TH:i:sP`
- **toDate:** the end date of the livestream, in format `Y-m-d\TH:i:sP`

### Kaltura Session 

The KS should have similar permissions as that passed to the App Launcher: 

```python
secret = "xxxxx"
user_id = "user-email-address"
k_type = KalturaSessionType.USER
partner_id = 1234567
expiry = 86400
privileges = "setrole:WEBCAST_PRODUCER_DEVICE_ROLE,sview:*,list:<ENTRY>,download:<ENTRY>"

result = client.session.start(secret, user_id, k_type, partner_id, expiry, privileges)
```

### Complete URL 

The final URL, after adding the params and URL-encoding, should look something like this:

```
https://www.kaltura.com/apps/webcast/vlatest/index.html?MediaEntryId=1_1sd21wtr&ks=djJ8MjM2NTQ5MXy7pYnF-OQYtGGuu0vWTDho3bNm25jOIhf_hrNJIPpdQMUPdWWt8QsCgXdnsjZ-p6l-BWsxQgtlJfblaNTIfNsTU6riE3fkKt3ubQkIxndMRinS3G8_AtW3nnUcpfTfRaSfEwXhBIVC_UfhoDyApTfr5IoOgj32CcS5uhKoXCLnHL2aB9saEKEC0XppwCkVBPPt1VTijhRCt1hC0mAq23z9&ks_expiry=2020-06-21+23%3A10%3A43.378412&qnaModeratorMode=True&serverAddress=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaltura.com%2F&fromDate=2020-06-20+23%3A12%3A43.378830&toDate=2020-06-20+23%3A18%3A43.378845
```

## Accessing Recordings 

Assuming that recording is enabled (`recordStatus` in the livestream creation), your recordings can be found in the [KMC](https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/content/entries/lis). You can also retrieve with the API by using the livestream Entry ID as the root entry, which will return all recordings that resulted from this entry. You'll use the [baseEntry.list](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/baseEntry/action/list) API, and note that it requires an ADMIN type Kaltura Session:

```python
filter = KalturaBaseEntryFilter()
filter.rootEntryIdEqual = <ENTRY ID>

result = client.baseEntry.list(filter)
```
